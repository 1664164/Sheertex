# Sheertex Skill Assessment Test

This assement is to test my understanding on how well I can transform "design files" into the code.

I had to create a project that hosted one page and code a layout that included a headr, 3 icons in the body, and a footer. The final versions of the project is suppose to be a home page that promotes the Sheertex products and even learn more about them. The project is setup using nextjs code with tailwindcss styling. 

This project took me six days to complete, 42 hours in total. The first two days, I had to fammilerise my self in nextjs and tailwindcss since it was the firts time I had to use these type of coding languages. The remainning four days was spent completing a nav component for the header, a footer component for the footer, and the three icons for the body.

The final version of project isn't a 100% replica of the eaxmple that was given but it is still very simillar.
